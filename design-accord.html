                    Accord is a digital to&#8211;do list centered around work&#8211;life balance. In contrast to other wellness and productivity tools, Accord's design considers users' lives holistically. It suggests personalized activities for a happier life &#8212; such as reaching out to an old friend &#8212; alongside reflecting on goals or scheduled work time. Users can adjust their recommendations with a "work&#8211;life slider" and compare their progress towards goals across their work, social relationships, and habits for health and mindfulness. Accord's visual design reflects this holistic vision. The planetary visual theme of the app reflects each user's internal world, with each person orbited by many different aspects of their lives. <br><br>
                    Over four months of user research, I narrowed the focus of Accord's design to target three specific problem areas faced by its users: breaking long&#8211;term goals down into accomplishable steps, developing happiness and well&#8211;being in the present, and balancing work and personal life. A refreshing list of recommendations allows users to focus less on streaks and artificial measurements of productivity and more on how completing these recommendations makes them feel over time. Accord's recommendations also draw from research by Yale professor Dr. Laurie Santos, who teaches a course on happiness and well&#8211;being. Presenting activities to users in a familiar to&#8211;do list format applies the satisfying feeling of crossing off a to&#8211;do to activities that Dr. Santos recommends for boosting overall happiness.
